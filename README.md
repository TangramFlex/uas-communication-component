# UAS Communication Component

This C++ application runs in conjunction with a Tangram-generated LMCP component software interface, and OpenAMASE (a simulation environment for testing of UAV control technologies).

It sends serialized LMCP `AirVehicleState` and `AirVehicleConfiguration` messages to OpenAMASE to visualize the behavior of the system.
